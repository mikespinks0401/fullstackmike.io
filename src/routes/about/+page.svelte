						Hello. My name is Michael Spinks. I built my first  gaming computer when I was either 16 or 17 years old and have always had a passion for technology ever since. Building that rig taught me that if I really wanted to do something bad enough, I can get it done. It wasn't until in my late 20s that I fully committed to learning how to program. What sparked that? The deep desire to possess the knowledge to build a SAAS products from A-Z solo. I have embarked on this journey of becoming a full stack developer and what follows is a little summary of how everything unfolded. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Over the course of my four years of learning, I have acquired a diverse set of
						programming languages and technologies. From PHP(where I learned the fundamentals of programming), HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to Linux, React,
						Tailwind, Vue 3, Nuxt 3, Node, Nginx, TypeScript, Git, MySQL, Cypress, GitHub Actions,
						JWT, Vuetify 3, Go, Svelte, and SvelteKit, I have explored a wide range of tools and
						frameworks that have shaped my skill set. Although I do not believe that I am a expert in any one area, I feel comfortable enough to dive into whatever part of the stack is necessary to get things moving forward.
					</p>
					<p>
						What I enjoy most about programming are the challenges that come with
						learning new technologies. I remember spending a good chucnk of time wrapping my head around the
						complexities of implementing an authentication system with JWT in Nuxt 3. I am proud of the fact that I can now confidently implement an auth system with a back-end language and JWT or whatever technology is required. Through
						perseverance and the ability to slow down and think critically, I have developed
						problem-solving skills that enable me to tackle any obstacle.
					</p>
					<p>
						While I appreciate both front-end and back-end development, I find myself more
						drawn to the backend, as it is where the business logic is implemented.However, I welcome and enjoy working through the challenges that come from either part of the stack. The end goal is never to simply get the necessary answer; it will always be to gain understanding.
					</p>
					<p>
						While I have pursued my programming journey solo, I am eager to
						collaborate and learn from other developers in a team enviroment. Being part of an awesome team of passionate
						individuals is one of my future goals as developer. Additionally, I aspire
						to dive deeper into Svelte and Go, sharpen my skills in Test-Driven Development(TDD),
						and deliver top-quality software.
					</p>
					<p>
						To stay up to date with the latest trends, I follow various tech-related YouTube
						channels that keep me informed on the latest news. When learning a new technology, I start by
						watching recent videos to familiarize myself with its practical applications. I then
						dive into the documentation, supplementing my learning with targeted Google searches
						when needed.
					</p>
					<p>
						One project that holds personal significance to me is a fitness application I developed
						in 2020 using JavaScript and a strap-on heart rate monitor. This project gained
						importance when my family was impacted by COVID, and we became more focused on our heart
						health. I intend on recreating the app with an enhanced design to further promote wellness. 
					</p>
					<p>
						As a self-taught developer, I take pride in my ability to overcome challenges and find
						solutions independently. My dedication to delivering secure and robust code sets me
						apart, as I consistently strive to ensure that my work is free of vulnerabilities.
					</p>
					<p>
						Looking ahead, I am excited about continuous learning and growth in the programming
						field. One of my contributions to the community will be sharing tutorials that assist
						aspiring developers on their learning journey, as I believe in giving back and helping
						others succeed. I hope to inspire and assist those that are crazy enough to take this serous. This journey has been one hell of a ride, but I wouldn't trade it for the world.
